Currently I am working as a [quantum
physicist](http://power1.pc.uec.ac.jp/~jenssss/). As part of this, I
write programs to simulate the time evolution of quantum systems. I
very much enjoy and feel passionate about the programming part of my
work, and I would like to pursue this even further. That is why I am
currently looking for a software engineering or data science job.

With a PhD in quantum physics I have a solid mathematical/technical
background. Through my work as a physicist I have gained extensive
experience using both efficient low-level languages like Fortran, and
more abstract high-level languages like Python.
